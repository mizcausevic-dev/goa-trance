Original note-only MIDI construction kits. Four kits, six core parts, two variations of each part. The parts are drums, bass, primary sequence, secondary sequence, motif, and harmonic field. Bass is monophonic. Odd-step groups are local cycles inside 4/4. They do not change the bar.

This repository is the pack. {PUBLICATION}

## What you can open

- `index.html` is the file catalog. Pick a kit, then variation A or B. The lanes are drawn from the fetched MIDI.
- `media.html` is the stills page. The film sits under the pictures.
- Each kit has a 32-bar Format 1 arrangement under `midi/`. Kit 01 is `midi/k01-seven-gate/arrangement.mid`.
- Individual Format 0 parts live beside that arrangement.
- `midi/validation-Cursor.json` is the report from reopening those exact bytes.
- `preview/preview.mp3` is the primary music preview. It is {preview['seconds_encoded']:.3f} seconds in the encoded file. {PREVIEW_LINE}.
- `film/preview.mp4` and `film/preview.vtt` are the film. On-picture and caption text is `{ON_PICTURE}`.
- `art/hero.jpg` is a 1280x720 illustration. `art/square.jpg` is 1080x1080. Neither is a photograph.

{WARNING}

## Kits

{kit_lines}

Core files: {catalog['core_part_count']}. Reference files: {catalog['reference_part_count']}.

{catalog['range_statement']} PPQ is 960. Meter is 4/4. A bar is 3840 ticks. Offsets are 0. Seeds identify kits and are not random draws. Generator {GENERATOR_VERSION}.

{catalog['odd_step']}

{cycle_lines}

## Preview path

The preview renders the first 16 bars of the kit 01 arrangement with `{RENDERER_VERSION}`. The arrangement is 32 bars, score length {excerpt['full_arrangement_seconds']:.3f} seconds, which is past the 40 second preview limit. The excerpt score length is {excerpt['score_seconds']:.3f} seconds. Tempo authority is the encoded microsecond value in the MIDI, {catalog['arrangement']['tempo_us']} us per quarter note. Sample positions use `floor(seconds * 44100 + 0.5)` from tick 0. Intervals are not summed. Sample-exact repeating loops at an arbitrary BPM are not promised.

The synth mapping is a simple-synth: kick and noise drums, a dull saw bass, a pulse primary sequence, a triangle secondary sequence, a sine motif, and a slow field. {PROGRAM} The mapping is not encoded in the MIDI.

Encoded MP3 settings: libmp3lame, 192 kbps. Film audio is AAC at 160 kbps re-encoded from that MP3, so the decoded film audio is not byte-identical to the MP3. Film duration probe: {film['duration_seconds']:.3f} seconds. {film['duration_relation']} The picture is a still illustration with rasterized disclosure text. DejaVu Sans Bold from the build machine supplies the glyphs. The font file is not in this pack.

{AUDITION} A sample peak is recorded in the preview manifest. It is not LUFS and it is not a true peak.

## Build

From the repository root, with Python 3.11+ and ffmpeg (libmp3lame, aac, libx264):

```bash
python3 tools/build_pack.py
python3 -m http.server 43201
```

The page is static. It is served with Python's HTTP server so the MIDI and media keep working relative paths. There is no application server and no package install. Standard library only.

`build/` holds the intermediate WAV, the procedural PPM, and the film plate. Those files are gitignored. The delivered audio is the MP3.

## Checks the validator actually runs

File existence, parse, PPQ, tempo, 4/4, end-of-track boundary, note pairing, ranges, monophonic bass and sequences, field polyphony cap of four, the drum map on channel 10, note-off before note-on at a shared tick, absence of program changes and other channel messages, departure flags against the declared pitch-class set, agreement with the canonical score, and agreement between each arrangement and the placed part files. Arrangement track count is taken from that arrangement spec. Core variations must differ in start, pitch, and duration, and variation A attack tuples must not be shared across kits. A negative overlap fixture is written outside the pack and must be rejected.

## Drafts and publication

Social captions, the X post, and the Medium article are drafts. They are not access controls. If this repository is public, the drafts are public. Do not treat them as posted to Instagram, X, or Medium.

Prepared repository description: Original note-only Goa Trance construction kits, with matched validation and a simple-synth preview.

Prepared topics: midi, goa-trance, trance, music-production, composition.

No release tag was created. `index.html` keeps its name because players and links depend on it. This page is the file catalog the pack requires.

## Limitations

Variation A parts of a kit are one set. Variation B parts are the other set. The 32-bar arrangement is the place those sets trade, in the sections named on the page. Do not stack a part file on the arrangement. The primary MP3 is bars 1-16 of kit 01, not the whole arrangement and not a master. These parts are original. They are not reconstructions of known tracks.

Caption

Goa Trance. Four kits of interlocking sequences, with odd-step cycles that stay inside 4/4. Six core parts, two variations each, note-only MIDI between 138 and 148 BPM. The audio preview is a simple-synth excerpt of kit 01, bars 1-16, not a master. No listening audition was performed for this build.

## What is local

The MIDI, matched validation report, MP3 ({preview['seconds_encoded']:.3f} s), MP4, VTT, raster stills, drafts, page, and README are in this working tree. Draft labels do not hide files. A public remote makes the drafts public.

## What was not done

No release tag was created. Nothing was posted to Medium, Instagram, or X. Topics are prepared, not assumed to be applied until the repository settings say so.

## Prepared metadata

Description: Original note-only Goa Trance construction kits, with matched validation and a simple-synth preview.

Topics: midi, goa-trance, trance, music-production, composition.

`index.html` is the Pages entry. `media.html` is the stills page. The deployment branch is gh-pages.

## Security note for a later deploy

The page is static. It has no form, no account system, and no secret. It links to MIDI and media in the same tree. A later deploy should not add a checkout or a lead form without a separate privacy review.
